bootstrapping the ground truth.

Within a condition (number of rats), randomly sample trajectories without 
regard to run, do the clustering analysis, repeat.

This will give us distributions for things like number of clusters, 
cluster sizes, etc. For which the rats cannot be responing to the other 
rats in the simulation. 

Boom.
