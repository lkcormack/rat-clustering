##list of possible parameters to extract from dbscan dataset

##Cluster ID, number of clusters by size by condition

##Duration of each cluster

##perhaps plot spectrogram of cluster occurrence color-coded by size across time

##Frequency of repeat clusters

##Core (seed) rats--those that are part of the cluster/meet minimal threshold

##Super core (seed) rats--those that are part of clusters, but may have more "connections" than the other cores.

##if repeated in frequency, the Super core rats may be central nodes within social networks. 
##this is of potential interest for this dataset, but even more so for the next dataset for which we'll have triadic dominance data for all rats in the environment. 


##for each sub-parameter extracted (e.g., cluster analysis), do the following:
##create distribution for bootstrapping motherfile, show mean condition-bootstrapping against mother-bootstrapped distribution. 
##create distribution for condition-bootstrapping, show mean condition-bound data against condition-bootstrapping OR mother-bootstrapped distribution. 
##perform inferential stats appropriate for generated distribution (maybe t, maybe z, maybe chi-square)
